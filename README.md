Introduction
The Economic Complexity Index (ECI) is a measure of the diversity and complexity of a country's economy. In this project, we explore the ECI trends of the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and India. We employ LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, and ARIMA, a classical time series analysis method, to forecast and analyze the ECI values for these countries.

Dataset
We utilize the ECI dataset for the BRICS nations and India. The dataset contains historical ECI values over a specified time period.

Methodology
LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of deep learning model that can capture sequential patterns in data. We use LSTM to forecast the future ECI values of the BRICS nations and India based on their historical ECI trends.

ARIMA
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a widely used statistical method for time series forecasting. We employ ARIMA to model the ECI time series data, extract relevant features, and make predictions.

Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/analysis-eci-lstm-arima.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd analysis-eci-lstm-arima
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the LSTM analysis: python lstm_analysis.py
Run the ARIMA analysis: python arima_analysis.py
Results
Our analysis reveals interesting insights into the economic complexity trends of the BRICS nations and India. The LSTM and ARIMA models provide valuable predictions and patterns that can aid in understanding the future trajectory of these countries' economies.
